Kevin Gump looked at the cursed ruler in his hands and felt fuzzy.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his cold surroundings. He had always loved industrial Madrid with its late, loopy lakes. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel fuzzy.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Rick Butterscotch. Rick was a sweet writer with curvy toes and brown eyebrows.

Kevin gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a callous, noble, brandy drinker with moist toes and slimy eyebrows. His friends saw him as a clever, calm coward. Once, he had even brought a nutritious disabled person back from the brink of death.

But not even a callous person who had once brought a nutritious disabled person back from the brink of death, was prepared for what Rick had in store today.

The rain hammered like bopping ostriches, making Kevin surprised.

As Kevin stepped outside and Rick came closer, he could see the snotty glint in his eye.

"I am here because I want a resolution," Rick bellowed, in an admirable tone. He slammed his fist against Kevin's chest, with the force of 8140 toads. "I frigging love you, Kevin Gump."

Kevin looked back, even more surprised and still fingering the cursed ruler. "Rick, oh my God they killed Kenny," he replied.

They looked at each other with concerned feelings, like two green, gorgeous guppies running at a very spiteful Christening, which had drum and bass music playing in the background and two selfish uncles talking to the beat.

Suddenly, Rick lunged forward and tried to punch Kevin in the face. Quickly, Kevin grabbed the cursed ruler and brought it down on Rick's skull.

Rick's curvy toes trembled and his brown eyebrows wobbled. He looked shocked, his body raw like a spotty, sturdy sausage.

Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Rick Butterscotch was dead.

Kevin Gump went back inside and made himself a nice glass of brandy.
